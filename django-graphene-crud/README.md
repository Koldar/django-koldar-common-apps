Introduction
============

This package allows you to generate CRUD operation in a compact way.
It is extensible but has sane default (at leastfor my project :] ).

This library is **not** a django application, although it works with it.

pip install django-graphene-crud-generator
```

The project is basically a factory that generates graphene types repersenting queries and mutations.
Each step of the generation process is extensible.
